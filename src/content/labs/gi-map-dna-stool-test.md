_Fully quantitative PCR DNA analysis of the microbiome. Includes beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, yeast, parasites and viruses. Also assesses intestinal health markers for digestion, absorption, immunology, and inflammation._



If you feel you digestion may be compromised this test looks at underlying
pathogens that could be at the root of the problem. But even if you arenâ€™t
having digestive complaints, this test can reveal answers to headaches,
autoimmune issues, inflammation concerns, constipation, infertility, skin
issues, fatigue and brain fog. Pairing this with the MRT food sensitivity
package is a great way to find the pathogens that are causing imbalances
within the body and then following a protocol that will heal and seal the gut
and kill off any pathogens that are causing concern and balancing the micro
biome.      Includes reading of results     To learn more about the GI-
