**Rhythm Plus with CAR (Cortisol Awakening Response) for cycling women**

The Rhythm Plus™ hormone test is a comprehensive assessment of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone spanning a full 28 days. Additionally, this hormone testing profile includes the Adrenocortex Stress Profile and the Comprehensive Melatonin Profile to reveal how the sex hormones are influenced by cortisol, DHEA, and melatonin. Hormone imbalances revealed in this hormone test can help illuminate root causes of disorders such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), infertility, and menstrual irregularities.

Hormonal balance is the key. Research has long shown that fluctuating levels of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone play a major role in a woman´s overall health.

Hormone imbalances can affect:

* Menstrual cycle

* Mood swings

* Sleep patterns

* Appetite level

* Sex drive

Chronic hormonal imbalances are implicated in disorders such as:

* PMS

* Anovulation

* Infertility

* Amenorrhea

* Endometriosis

* Polycystic Ovary Disease

* Osteoporosis

Saliva hormone testing provides a thorough analysis of estradiol and progesterone over a full 28 day cycle. Testosterone is measured once from the 28th day specimen. By utilizing 11 saliva samples for analysis, the relationship and balance of these essential hormones are analyzed more precisely through time. The levels of estradiol and progesterone, as well as the ratio between the two, are clearly graphed for easy reference and patient education.

Unlike serum measurements that typically reflect both bound and unbound fractions of hormones, salivary samples represent only the free (unbound) bioavailable fraction of hormone. Factors that affect binding globulin such as obesity and thyroid function do not influence test results with false high or low test levels.

Rhythm Plus™ is a hormonal test indicated for both premenopausal and perimenopauseal women not currently supplementing with hormones. An analysis of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone can reveal ovulatory function and trends in hormone production. Hormonal imbalances such as unopposed estrogen, high follicular progesterone, anovulation and luteal phase defects are easily identified. This hormone test is especially useful in treatment of patients with chronic gynecologic disorders. Additionally, Rhythm Plus includes a circadian analysis of cortisol, melatonin, and an assay of DHEA.


**Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)**

Two awakening samples to evaluate CAR

CAR is a transient, immediate rise in cortisol upon awakening and is distinct from the diurnal rhythm. CAR reflects a person's ability to cope with anticipated challenges and their perception of control around chronic stress, providing insight into HPA axis resiliency.
