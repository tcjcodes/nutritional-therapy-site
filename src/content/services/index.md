I am passionate to helping you strengthen and find the healthier version of yourself.  Bringing back the vitality and support your body's needs, for a healthier, 

I value wholefoods, nutrient-dense, organic, non-gmo, free-range, locally raised meats, etc...    I enjoy eating good quality fats, such as coconut oil, butter, ghee, duck fat, tallow, lard, cold-pressed olive oil, flax oil, avocado oil..  I value and appreciate supporting local and  farm to table fresh foods/meat. 

As a certified Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, I seek to make connections between the physical body and emotional state, by supporting both.  I am passionate to assist you in your journey to a path to your optimal health..

Where are you on the spectrum between Balance and Disease?

As a Function Nutritionist, I focus on addressing the underlying cause of the dysfunction through balancing the foundational systems of the body.  Many times conventional medicine only treats the symptom, not the underlying cause.  As a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner , I am able to use a variety of effective diagnostic tools to locate where the deficiency or imbalance is in the body and then provide nutritional support to help body’s innate ability to heal.  

The root cause of many symptoms are digestive issues.  With this in mind, my practice focuses on balancing digestive system issues by identifying and removing stressors, then providing your body with the proper nutrition to heal.  

Foods that are highly processed, which make up the Standard American Diet, do not provide the nutrition to keep our bodies healthy. This has led to many of the chronic illnesses that are prevalent in our world today - Autoimmune, Diabetes, Coronary Heart Disease and Cancer, to name a few. I believe that a nutrient dense, properly prepared, ancestral based whole-food diet, is the foundation for supporting optimal health.

There is no one perfect diet for everyone, so we work with you to find the ideal whole food diet that will enhance your bodies ability to heal.  We also use professional grade supplements to target the nutrients that your body is looking for to help it achieve balance. ​

First Consultation
Lorem ipsum dolores

In our initial session, we assess your current health baseline and discuss
your health and wellness concerns, goals, and priorities. This
consultation includes a comprehensive health assessment, dietary review,
and online nutritional assessment questionnaire. 

Initial Consultation (Approximately 90 minutes, either virtually or
in-person) 

You will be introduced to the functional evaluation, and we use the
information from the initial consultation and a variety of techniques
(reflex points, palpations, muscle and lingual-neuro tests) to discover
where your body may be out of balance. We use all of these puzzle pieces
to determine which nutrients will best support your body moving to a more
balanced state.

Follow Up Appointments (Approximately 60 minutes)
These sessions are tailored for you. We will discuss your progress,
revisit your goals and priorities, and use various functional evaluation
assessments to refine your protocol. Your body is constantly trying to
create balance from within.

order to set you up for success on your healing journey.
