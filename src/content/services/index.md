### Free 20 minute Consultation for Functional Nutrition

Together let's identify and assess your current health baseline and discuss your health concern and goals.  This consultation will help identify the deficiency and imbalances with the goal of gently guiding individuals back on the path to health.

### Initial Consultation

#### (Approximately 90 minutes, either in-person or virtually)

In our initial session, we assess your current health baseline and discuss your health and wellness concerns, goals, and priorities. This consultation includes a comprehensive health assessment, dietary review, and online nutritional assessment questionnaire.

You will be introduced to the functional evaluation, and we use the
information from the initial consultation and a variety of techniques
(reflex points, palpations, muscle testing, and lingual-neuro tests) to discover
where your body may be out of balance. We use all of these puzzle pieces
to determine which nutrients will best support your body moving to a more
balanced state.

### Follow Up Appointments

#### (Approximately 60 minutes)

These sessions are tailored for you. We will discuss your progress,
revisit your goals and priorities, and use various functional evaluation
assessments to refine your protocol. Your body is constantly trying to
create balance from within. 

We ask that new clients commit to a minimum of a three-month package in
order to set you up for success on your healing journey.

* 3 months/5 visits - $475 ($95/session)
* 6 months/9 visits - $765 ($85/session)
* 12 months/15 visits $1,125 ($75/session)

### Packages

Packages include unlimited text and email support. If there is an issue
that cannot be adequately resolved via electronic communication, you will
be asked to schedule a session.

### Individual Sessions

sessions at $100-125 or continue with an additional package.
