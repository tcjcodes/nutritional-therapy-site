### Free 20 minute Consultation for Functional Nutrition

Together we will identify and assess your current health baseline and discuss your health concern and goals.  This consultation will help identify the deficiency and imbalances with the goal of gently guiding individuals back on the path to health.

### Initial Nutritional Consultation $125

#### (Approximately 90 minutes, either in-person or virtually)

In our initial session, we assess your current health baseline and discuss your health and wellness concerns, goals, and priorities. This consultation includes a comprehensive health assessment, dietary review, and online nutritional assessment questionnaire.

You will be introduced to the functional evaluation, and we use the
information from the initial consultation and a variety of techniques
(reflex points, palpations, muscle testing, and lingual-neuro tests) to discover
where your body may be out of balance. We use all of these puzzle pieces
to determine which nutrients will best support your body moving to a more
balanced state.

### Applied Psycho-Neurobiology (APN): Healing Through Mind-Body Connection

Developed by Dr Dietrich Klinghardt, this technique combines biofeedback-guided, emotional guidance, color therapy, eye movement, and gentle energetic techniques to release emotional blockages.
