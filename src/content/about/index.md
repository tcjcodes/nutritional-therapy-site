Functional Nutrition - NTP

Restorative Wellness Practitioner - RWP

Applied Psycho-Neurobiology - APN
        

As a functional nutritionist, I look for deeper underlying imbalances and deficiencies to restore health and function. I use a complete, holistic evaluation that may include testing, detailed nutritional assessment, dietary and health history overview to gather in-depth understanding of your biochemistry and current health status. Based on the gathered information, I create a customized nutritional program and recommend a supplemental protocol when needed. I help clients who are struggling with digestive problems, autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, hormonal imbalances, skin problems, high blood pressure and other conditions.

I am passionate to helping you strengthen and find the healthier version of yourself.  Bringing back the vitality and support your body's needs, for a healthier, 

I value wholefoods, nutrient-dense, organic, non-gmo, free-range, locally raised meats, etc...    I enjoy eating good quality fats, such as coconut oil, butter, ghee, duck fat, tallow, lard, cold-pressed olive oil, flax oil, avocado oil..  I value and appreciate supporting local and  farm to table fresh foods/meat. 

As a certified Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, I seek to make connections between the physical body and emotional state, by supporting both.  I am passionate to assist you in your journey to a path to your optimal health..

Where are you on the spectrum between Balance and Disease?

As a Function Nutritionist, I focus on addressing the underlying cause of the dysfunction through balancing the foundational systems of the body.  Many times conventional medicine only treats the symptom, not the underlying cause.  As a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner , I am able to use a variety of effective diagnostic tools to locate where the deficiency or imbalance is in the body and then provide nutritional support to help body’s innate ability to heal.  

The root cause of many symptoms are digestive issues.  With this in mind, my practice focuses on balancing digestive system issues by identifying and removing stressors, then providing your body with the proper nutrition to heal.  

Foods that are highly processed, which make up the Standard American Diet, do not provide the nutrition to keep our bodies healthy. This has led to many of the chronic illnesses that are prevalent in our world today - Autoimmune, Diabetes, Coronary Heart Disease and Cancer, to name a few. I believe that a nutrient dense, properly prepared, ancestral based whole-food diet, is the foundation for supporting optimal health.

There is no one perfect diet for everyone, so we work with you to find the ideal whole food diet that will enhance your bodies ability to heal.  We also use professional grade supplements to target the nutrients that your body is looking for to help it achieve balance. ​
