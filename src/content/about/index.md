**If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, let's schedule *[free 20 minute phone consult](/services)* to discuss your health concerns and goals.  I am here to help you take the next step towarch achieving a healthier, more balanced life.**

I am passionate about helping you rediscover your vitality and support your body's natural healing processes.  My approach is rooted in a deep appreciation for whole, nutrient-dense foods—organic, non-GMO, locally sourced, grass-fed and free-range products that nourish both body and soul.  I value quality fats such as coconut oil, butter, ghee, duck fat, tallow, cold-pressed olive oil, flax oil, and avocado oil, and I believe in the importance of supporting local farms and farm-to-table practices.

As a certified Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (FNTP), I connect the physical and emotional aspect of health, offering holistic support for you journey to optimal wellness. I'm committed to helping you find balance, whether you're seeking to overcome chronic illness or simply improve your well-being?

**T﻿oday, where does your wellness journey stand - between vitality and disease?**

As a Function Nutritionist, I specialized in addressing the underlying causes of dysfunction by restoring balance to the body's foundation systems.  While conventional medicine often focuses on treating symptoms, I use a variety of diagnostic tools and advanced specialized testing to pinpoint deficiencies or imbalances, then offer targeted nutritional support to help your body's innate ability to heal.

One of the root causes of many health concern is digestive dysfunction.  That's why my practice centers around identifying and removing digestive stressors, while providing the necessary nutrients to promote vitality and restoration.

The Standard American Diet, rich in processed foods, lack the nutrients our bodies need to thrive.  This dietary pattern has contributed to the rise of chronic illness such as autoimmune disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.  I believe that a nutrient-dense, properly prepared, and ancestral-based whole-food diet is essential to supporting long-term heath.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition.  Together, we will work to identify the best supports your body's unique healing process.  In addition, I use professional-grade and whole food base supplements to provide specific nutrients your body needs to restore overall balance and function.
