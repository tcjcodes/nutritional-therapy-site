**If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, let's schedule *[free 20 minute phone consult](/services)* to discuss your health concerns and goals.  I am here to help you take the next step towarch achieving a healthier, more balanced life.**

I am passionate about helping you rediscover your vitality and support your body's natural healing processes.  My approach is rooted in a deep appreciation for whole, nutrient-dense foods - organic, non-GMO, locally sourced, grass-fed and free-range products that nourish both body and soul.  I value quality fats such as coconut oil, butter, ghee, duck fat, tallow, cold-pressed olive oil, flax oil, and avocado oil, and I believe in the importance of supporting local farms and farm-to-table practices.

As a certified Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (FNTP), I connect the physical and emotional aspect of health, offering holistic support for you journey to optimal wellness. I'm committed to helping you find balance, whether you're seeking to overcome chronic illness or simply improve your well-being?



**Where are you on the spectrum between Balance and Disease?**

As a Function Nutritionist, I focus on addressing the underlying cause of the dysfunction through balancing the foundational systems of the body.  Many times conventional medicine only treats the symptom, not the underlying cause.  As a FNTP, I am able to use a variety of effective diagnostic tools to locate where the deficiency or imbalance is in the body and then provide nutritional support to help body’s innate ability to heal.  

The root cause of many symptoms are digestive issues.  With this in mind, my practice focuses on balancing digestive system issues by identifying and removing stressors, then providing your body with the proper nutrition to heal.  

Foods that are highly processed, which make up the Standard American Diet, do not provide the nutrition to keep our bodies healthy.  This has led to many of the chronic illnesses that are prevalent in our world today - Autoimmune, Diabetes, Coronary Heart Disease and Cancer, to name a few.  I believe that a nutrient dense, properly prepared, ancestral based whole-food diet, is the foundation for supporting optimal health.

There is no one perfect diet for everyone, so we work with you to find the ideal whole food diet that will enhance your bodies ability to heal.  We also use professional grade supplements to target the nutrients that your body is looking for to help it achieve balance. ​
