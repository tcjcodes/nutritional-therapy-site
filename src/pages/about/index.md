(I'm just free-writing. Processing my thoughts, while inspiring myself to see it here.)

I value wholefoods, nutrient-dense, organic, non-gmo, free-range, locally raised meats, etc...    I enjoy eating good quality fats, such as coconut oil, butter, ghee, duck fat, tallow, lard, cold-pressed olive oil, flax oil, avocado oil..  I value and appreciate supporting local and  farm to table fresh foods/meat. 

As a certified Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, I seek to make connections between the physical body and emotional state, by supporting both.  I am passionate to assist you in your journey to a path to your optimal health.
