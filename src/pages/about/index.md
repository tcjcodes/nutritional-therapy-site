I am passionate to helping you strengthen and find the healthier version of yourself.  Bringing back the vitality and support your body's needs, for a healthier, 

I value wholefoods, nutrient-dense, organic, non-gmo, free-range, locally raised meats, etc...    I enjoy eating good quality fats, such as coconut oil, butter, ghee, duck fat, tallow, lard, cold-pressed olive oil, flax oil, avocado oil..  I value and appreciate supporting local and  farm to table fresh foods/meat. 



As a certified Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, I seek to make connections between the physical body and emotional state, by supporting both.  I am passionate to assist you in your journey to a path to your optimal health..



Where are you on the spectrum between Balance and Disease?

As a Function Nutritionist, I focus on addressing the underlying cause of the dysfunction through balancing the foundational systems of the body.  Many times conventional medicine only treats the symptom, not the underlying cause.  As a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner , I am able to use a variety of effective diagnostic tools to locate where the deficiency or imbalance is in the body and then provide nutritional support to help bodyâ€™s innate ability to heal.  

The root cause of many symptoms are digestive issues.  With this in mind, my practice focuses on balancing digestive system issues by identifying and removing stressors, then providing your body with the proper nutrition to heal.
