    name: First Consultation
  - description: >-
      In our initial session, we assess your current health baseline and discuss
      your health and wellness concerns, goals, and priorities. This
      consultation includes a comprehensive health assessment, dietary review,
      and online nutritional assessment questionnaire. 


      You will be introduced to the functional evaluation, and we use the
      information from the initial consultation and a variety of techniques
      (reflex points, palpations, muscle and lingual-neuro tests) to discover
      where your body may be out of balance. We use all of these puzzle pieces
      to determine which nutrients will best support your body moving to a more
      balanced state.
